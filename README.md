# MNIST MultiDigit Prediction
This Jupyter notebook, [multidigit.ipynb](https://github.com/sadat-rk/MNIST/blob/main/multidigit.ipynb), demonstrates the application of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images containing multiple handwritten digits. The project leverages the MNIST dataset, where each image is crafted by horizontally concatenating five random single-digit images (each 28x28 pixels) into a single image of shape (28, 140, 1). The trained CNN predicts the sequence of these five digits, showcasing an extension of the classic single-digit classification task.

## Dataset
*  MNIST Dataset: A widely-used collection of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), split into 60,000 training and 10,000 testing samples.
*  Multi-Digit Images: Custom-generated by combining five MNIST digits side-by-side, resulting in images of shape (28, 140, 1).
*  Labels: Each multi-digit image is labeled with the sequence of its five digits (e.g., "12345", zero never comes at first).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Model Architecture
*  The CNN is implemented using Keras with TensorFlow as the backend. While the exact model definition is not shown in the provided snippet, it typically includes:
Convolutional Layers: Extract spatial features from the multi-digit images.
Max-Pooling Layers: Reduce spatial dimensions while retaining important features.
Dense Layers: Perform classification based on extracted features.
Output: Predicts the sequence of five digits, likely as a vector of probabilities or values scaled to represent digits.

## Potential Improvements

To enhance the projectâ€™s complexity and performance, consider the following:
*  Variable-Length Digit Sequences: The current dataset is limited to five-digit sequences. To increase complexity, the dataset could be expanded to include sequences of varying lengths (1 to 5 digits). This would require the model to handle variable input and output sizes, making the prediction task more challenging and realistic for real-world applications, such as reading arbitrary-length numbers in forms or documents.
*  Incorporating LSTM Layers: The current model relies solely on CNN layers to extract spatial features. To improve performance, especially for variable-length sequences, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers could be integrated. LSTMs are well-suited for sequential data, as they can capture temporal dependencies across digits, enabling better handling of non-fixed input/output lengths and improving robustness for complex sequence predictions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Notes
*  Data Preprocessing: MNIST images are normalized (divided by 255), reshaped, and labels are one-hot encoded. Multi-digit image creation is inferred but not explicitly shown.
*  Model Training: Training details (e.g., optimizer, loss function, epochs) are not visible in the provided snippet but are assumed to follow standard CNN practices.
*  Visualization: The notebook visualizes four test images with predicted five-digit sequences, where outputs are scaled by 255 and rounded (potentially indicating a non-standard output format).
*  Exploration: Users can experiment with model architectures, sequence lengths, or additional layers (e.g., LSTMs) to enhance performance.

## SingleDigit Prediction
*  A single Digit classification project is implemented in the folder [SingleDigit](https://github.com/sadat-rk/MNIST/tree/main/SingleDigit).
