# MNIST Digit Classification with CNNs

## Project Overview

This project implements and compares three Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures—LeNet-5, CNN0, and CNN1—for digit classification using the MNIST dataset. The goal is to train and evaluate these models to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) with high accuracy.

## Features
*  Dataset: Utilizes the MNIST dataset, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.
*  Models:
  *  LeNet-5: A classic CNN architecture with two convolutional layers, two pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
  *  CNN0: A custom CNN with three convolutional layers, three pooling layers, and increased filter sizes.
  *  CNN1: A CNN with two convolutional layers, one pooling layer, dropout for regularization, and a sigmoid activation in the dense layer.
*  Preprocessing: Includes reshaping, normalizing pixel values, and one-hot encoding labels.
*  Training: Models are trained with configurable epochs and batch sizes, using SGD or Adam optimizers.
*  Evaluation: Visualizes training/validation accuracy and loss, and displays sample predictions.
